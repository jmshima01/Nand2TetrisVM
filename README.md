1) James Shima
2) Few days, took me a while to learn the memory segmegmentation before I could code
3) Sorry this is a day late midterms been really rough :/ 
I used `go` again and I think what really helped me to understand the memory segmentation of Hack.
I also looked back a lot at `Pong.asm` and that helped me realize what each instruction should 
look like in an optimal way (kinda a little reverse engineering).
