Golang

I used the latest version go1.22.0+
When running `go version` on Ubuntu you should see...

`go version go1.22.0 linux/amd64`

My code should also work and compile for go1.18.1+ if you already have it installed (but no promises though)
No external libs where used that shouldn't already be included

Offical way to install latest version:
https://go.dev/doc/install

Alternative way I installed Go on Ubuntu 22.04 if above doesn't work (Should work the same for 20.04 I use 22.04 for dev):
`wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.22.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz`
`sudo tar -xvf go1.22.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz -C /usr/local`
`echo "export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin" >> ~/.profile`
`source ~/.profile`
`go version`
